Description: Emulalate sysv runlevel 5 by default
 Currently, not many daemons in Debian provides proper runscripts, so
 if user switches to runit, she will on next reboot, that none of daemons,
 including essential, like cron, are started.
 .
 This patch starts them in sysv-init style -- unmanaged, in background.
 It is sub-par solution, but allows one-by-one transition.
